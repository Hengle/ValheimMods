Allows tweaking various death related values. You can make death softer or harder as desired by editing the config.

* Tune the death penalty skill level loss percentage.
* Toggle whether skill progress towards the next level is reset.
* Modify the duration of the "No Skill Loss" buff.
* Modify the duration of the "Corpse Run" buff.

Run the game once with the mod enabled to generate the config. See config for details on what each option does.

This mod is client only and does not need to be installed on dedicated servers. For the best experience, all clients should use the same configuration.
