Health and stamina from food follows the curve ``y=1-x^8`` instead of the vanilla curve ``y=(1-x)^0.3``. This means that 50% of the way through the food, you are still getting nearly 100% of the benefit (vs 81%) and 75% of the way through you are still getting about 90% of the benefit (vs 65%). Values drop sharply as you near the end. This does not increase the overall duration of food, only makes more of the duration useful.

Run the game once with the mod enabled to generate the config. See config for details on what each option does.

Tip: The exponent of the curve is configurable. To visualize the food curve and see how different exponents look, enter the above formula into a graphing calculator such as [this one](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and change the ``8`` to whatever number you want to see.

This mod is client only and does not need to be installed on dedicated servers. For the best experience, all clients should use the same configuration.

## Installation
